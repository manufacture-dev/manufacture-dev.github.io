  content : "Raising the bar is not an end for us, but only a way to improve the performance of your teams.
  We do not use maturity indicators and prefer to rely on tangible measures of the performance of your teams.
  We are based on the 2019 Accelerate State of DevOps study which identifies the 4 key metrics for measuring the performance of development teams:
  - Deployment Frequency
  - Lead Time for Changes
  - Change Failure Rate
  - Time to Restore Service"
