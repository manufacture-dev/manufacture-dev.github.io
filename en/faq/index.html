<p><strong>What is an efficient agile organization?</strong></p>
<p>An organization capable of producing and delivering quality products without it being an event.</p>
<p>An organization with a culture of continuous improvement and sharing within teams.</p>
<p><strong>What does technical coaching consist of?</strong></p>
<p>Technical coaching aims to increase the skills of teams in mastering their code and their pipeline to make their delivery more reliable.</p>
<p><strong>What is a technical coach?</strong></p>
<p>A technical coach is a training developer with solid technical expertise and coaching skills supported by his passion for his profession and his desire to transmit his knowledge and his culture to others.</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between a technical coach and an agile (flow) coach?</strong></p>
<p>Both are involved in teams but the difference can be appreciated in the scope of action.</p>
<p>The agile coach is involved in the organization of the team&rsquo;s work and therefore will work on the team&rsquo;s culture (agile)</p>
<p>The technical coach will act on work practices (code, pipeline) and team culture (craft and devops)</p>
<p>The 2 are complementary, but in general, the technical coach intervenes after the intervention of the agile coach, once it becomes necessary to put the focus back on people and work practices when the work organization is resolved.</p>
<p><strong>What is the difference between a technical coach and an organizational coach (scale)?</strong></p>
<p>The difference can be appreciated in the way of intervening:</p>
<p>The organizational coach intervenes at the top management level to have an impact at the team level (Top Down approach)</p>
<p>The technical coach intervenes in immersion within the teams for in-depth work. He will rely on them to seek the systemic impact (Bottom Up approach)</p>
<p>The 2 are complementary and we often have to work together in our missions.</p>
<p><strong>What is the role of the technical coach?</strong></p>
<p>Its role is to intervene with the teams to transmit good practices, the good use of tools and the good culture in order to orient the organization towards sustainable efficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Help teams gain autonomy over their practices</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improve the capacity of teams to deliver and therefore their performance</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support change</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Instill a culture of continuous improvement and sharing within the organization</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What are the characteristics of the teams accompanied by a technical coach?</strong></p>
<p>They are agile, product-oriented and multidisciplinary teams.</p>
<p><strong>Is agility a prerequisite?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, whether it is in progress or completed.</p>
<p>It allows the coach to intervene in an iterative manner and to be able to measure the impacts of continuous coaching on the quality of product developments and on the efficiency of delivery.</p>
<p><strong>What does the technical coach do with the teams?</strong></p>
<p>It develops with them the functionalities of the backlog directly on their code base</p>
<p>It improves and implements CI / CD processes and practices</p>
<p><strong>How many teams can a technical coach support?</strong></p>
<p>A maximum of 1 to 3 teams in parallel over the same period of time, depending on the context and the size of the teams.</p>
<p>At the start of the immersion phase, it is best to start with one team and then gradually increase the number of teams over subsequent cycles.</p>
<p>It is recommended not to exceed 4 teams supported in parallel in order to maintain flexibility in the event of unforeseen events (management of unforeseen events, focus on a particular team if necessary, etc.).</p>
<p><strong>How do I know if my teams need technical coaching?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You notice a loss of control over your delivery (more and more bugs and support which complicate deliveries in Production).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You struggle to deliver more often and with better quality.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Your teams are finding it difficult to be responsible over the entire delivery chain (Dev to Prod) in this new organization.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is the time to step in to restore their confidence and control, recreate commitment, passion and retain talent.</p>
<p><strong>I don&rsquo;t know which team to support?</strong></p>
<p>The choice of the first team to support is important.</p>
<p>2 prerequisites are therefore recommended to choose your team:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Favor the most motivated teams because a team that wants to improve will give itself the means to do so.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Check management&rsquo;s support for their team so that they can have the necessary time to improve their practices (reduce the number of delivery constraints for the team concerned).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>My teams are not motivated, what to do?</strong></p>
<p>It is important to raise awareness among demotivated teams in order to gradually arouse their interest:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Encourage the sharing of the 1st team supported on their learning and difficulties within communities of practice</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invite teams to learning hours or Mob programming sessions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This will be a real trigger thanks to the influence on other teams and the organization, which will facilitate the mandate with management and support for new teams.</p>
<p><strong>What are the key success factors of technical coaching?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Relays of trust within the team.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sharing what has been learned to demonstrate the value of new practices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The factual measure:</p>
</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The sustainability of coaching (learning and mastery of practices by teams, autonomy, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Impacts on the team&rsquo;s delivery capacity and on its performance.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What if I did not reach my goals during the coaching?</strong></p>
<p>It is expected that the coaching system will be reviewed regularly between the coach and management (quarterly for example) to ensure that we are still aligned with ambitions and objectives.</p>
<p>This thus makes it possible to revise upwards or downwards the number of coaches working on the perimeter according to the new needs which would have been expressed during the first cycles of support.</p>
<p><strong>What are the management&rsquo;s commitments to its coached teams?</strong></p>
<p>You agree to:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Bring ambition to your organization to facilitate the coach&rsquo;s intervention within teams.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Devote time and a lot of practice to learning to have a lasting impact.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Support your teams in their learning: it is not linear but means that the team is progressing.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>What is the decisional latitude of the technical coach?</strong></p>
<p>When experimenting with practices and approaches in the field, the technical coach may need to reorganize the teams but also the processes and interactions based on observation. This is done in close collaboration with management.</p>
<p>He always supports people in the change process and optimizes the use by the teams of internal support and service levers in the organization.</p>
<p><strong>I am seeing a slowdown in the performance of my teams, is this normal?</strong></p>
<p>Learning new practices is far from linear.
The euphoria of the start can run out of steam if it is not supported by efforts of training.</p>
<p>This shortness of breath is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;learning trough&rdquo;.
It is manifested by a decrease in the general performance of the team level.</p>
<p>The common mistake is to conclude that the learning method is not working and that we have to go back to the front.
This is exactly when you shouldn&rsquo;t give up anything!</p>
<p>The hollow means precisely that the methods are being acquired and that there are adjustments to be made.</p>
<p>Management support for its teams is decisive in encouraging them to persevere in their skills development.</p>
<p>Perseverance will thus lead the teams to significantly exceed their previous level!</p>
